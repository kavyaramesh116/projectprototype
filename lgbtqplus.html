<body><H3>What is LGBTQ+ ?</H3></body>
<body><H5>In case this term didn't ring a bell. LGBTQ+ is a term to describe sexuality. It stands for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer and ofcourse, plus such as those questioning, pansexual, asexual, and so much more.</body><H5>
<body><H3>A little backstory:</H3><body>
<body><H5>It was originally known as 'LGBT' which started in 1951 & the 'Q+' was added later on in 2016. </body></H5>
<body><H3>Lesbian</H3><body>
<body><H5>A lesbian is a female homosexual: a female who experiences romantic love or sexual attraction to other females.</H5></body>
<body><H3>Gay</H3><body>
<body><H5>Gay is a term that primarily refers to a homosexual person or the trait of being homosexual. Gay is often used to describe homosexual males but lesbians may also be referred to as gay.</H5><body>
<body><H3>Bisexual</H3><body>
<body><H5>Bisexuality is romantic attraction, sexual attraction or sexual behavior toward both males and females, or romantic or sexual attraction to people of any sex or gender identity; this latter aspect is sometimes termed pansexuality.</H5><body>
<body><H3>Transgender</H3><body>
<body><H5>Transgender is an umbrella term for people whose gender identity differs from what is typically associated with the sex they were assigned at birth. It is sometimes abbreviated to trans.</H5><body>
<body><H3>Queer</H3><body>
<body><H5>
Queer is an umbrella term for sexual and gender minorities that are not heterosexual or cisgender. Queer was originally used pejoratively against those with same-sex desires but, beginning in the late-1980s, queer scholars and activists began to reclaim the word.</H5><body>
